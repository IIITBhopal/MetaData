# MetaData
Data about data :)

This repository contains the data about the Institute's activity and presence in GitHub.

It is also meant to be a guide and introduction forum for the members.

# Objectives

The objective of the Institute's open-source programs is to foster the coding culture in the institute and
thereby produce excellent pieces of code as a by-product which would prove to be useful to the larger community
of open-source software.

Further objectives regarding the projects can be found in the Objectives directory (to be uploaded) of this repository.

# Code of conduct

Be respectful in the comments and your interaction with other members of this Institute.

We all have our problems and are limited in a sense, thus we should be kind to our fellow developers
in helping them out with their questions and queries about stuff you know better.

In the interest of fostering open research and collaborative environment, we members pledge to make
participation in our projects and community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

Knowledge and code sharing should and will be our utmost priority.

And cool reception of any form of constructive criticism is advised.

Any unobservance of the above principles can and will cause expulsion from the Insitute's open-source programs.

# Contribution Guide

Soon to be uploaded.
